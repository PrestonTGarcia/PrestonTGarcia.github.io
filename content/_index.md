        My mission is to apply my research objectives to develop innovations that help the communities that I come from, whether that be the world, or where I grew up in - Hawai'i.

        I work on projects relating to the applications of AI, ML, data science, and mathematics to physical science fields such as physics and atmospheric sciences.

        Please feel free to reach out to collaborate.
