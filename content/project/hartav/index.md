A project posed by Honolulu Authority of Rapid Transportation (HART) of hypothetical autonomous vehicle (AV) rideshare system in Hawaii.

<!--more-->

New transportation modes have been recently emerging within Hawaii from Biki bikeshares to HART's developing skyline. With talks on a developing autonomous shuttle system at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH Manoa), the potential value of an AV rideshare system was to be discussed. This project simulates the AV rideshare from collected data on household activities, and compares the performance of AV simulations to the status quo as well as hypothetical skyline scenarios. 

Conducting this project was my first step into the field of research and applying data science and data analysis techniques to other fields. I had learned the difficulty of picking up the disciplines of other fields with no prior knowledge, as before doing this project I had no knowledge of transportation engineering methods and research. Although difficult, I was able to gain experience in reading research papers despite how daunting the content seems. Presentation and communication skills were also improved through this project, as at the end of the project I was required to give a presentation at the undergraduate project showcase.
