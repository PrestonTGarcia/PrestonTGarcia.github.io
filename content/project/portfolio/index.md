A professional portfolio recently redesigned to show off my professional blogs, publications, and projects.

One of the projects that I had done in my ICS 314 course were a professional portfolio - a website that would serve as a medium to share my projects, papers, blogs, and experiences. Although I had been updating my professional portfolio, looking at my old portfolio it looked incredibly outdated. As a result, I had made it a goal to rehaul the design of the professional portfolio in order for people to explore my research and qualifications.

Instead of remaking the design of the website completely from scratch, I used Github to look through templates and forked the template that looked the best for my uses. After browsing the [portfolio-template](https://github.com/topics/portfolio-template) repository collection, I ended up choosing the [HugoBlox Academic Theme](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv) due to the overall design of the professional portfolio and potential for what I would like to show using my portfolio in the future - that being projects, blogs, and publications.

The portfolio template was created using [HugoBlox](https://hugoblox.com/), so minimal code was created for this redesign of my professional portfolio. Although I would have preferred a template with more code, my coding knowledge of how yaml settings work in tandem with websites proved helpful in redesigning my website. An example of this is the featured projects section on the homepage, as featuring projects was not in the HugoBlox documentation, but I was able to configure it so that my projects are featured. Future directions for my portfolio are adding in blogs, publications, completing more projects, and redesigning once again with my own coded website.
